Hi, I am an undergraduate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China] & [University of Glasgow]. My research interests focus on signal processing, optimization algorithms and ultrasound imaging analysis.
I was a research intern in [electrical & computer engineering department], Rutgers University in this summer, where I researched under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Yuan].
