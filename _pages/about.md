I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html). Prior to that, I received dual Bachelor's degrees in Communication Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and [University of Glasgow (UoG)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) (Graduated with First-class honor degree) in 2020. Additionally, I worked as a full-time research engineer in [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) from 2020 to 2021.
