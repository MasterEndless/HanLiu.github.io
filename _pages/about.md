I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ning Zhang](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/ning/index.html). Prior to that, I received dual Bachelor's degrees in Communication Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and [University of Glasgow (UoG)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) (Graduated with First-class honor degree) in 2020. Additionally, I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) from 2020 to 2021, and I was an applied scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in the summer of 2023. Most recently, I worked as a research scientist intern at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/) in the summer of 2024 and am currently continuing with Meta as a part-time student researcher for the Fall of 2024.

<span style="color:red;">I am expected to graduate in May 2025 and am actively seeking full-time opportunities for research or applied scientist positions. Feel free to contact me at h.liu1@wustl.edu.</span>
